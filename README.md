                            Telegram Bot for Book Generation



                            
This is a Python Telegram bot that generates book outlines and full chapters based on user input. The bot interacts with the user to collect information about the book, such as the topic, number of chapters, writing style, and more. It then generates a book plan (outline) and subsequently, full chapters for the book using the OpenAI API.

                                    Prerequisites




Before running the bot, make sure you have the folowing installed:

Python 3.x
Required Python packages: openai, asyncgpt, aiogram, httpx
You can install the required packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai asyncgpt aiogram httpx
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Create a configuration file named config.py in the same directory as the main Python script (bot.py). In this file, define your OpenAI API key and Telegram bot API key as follows:

python
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'
TELEGRAM_API_KEY = 'your_telegram_api_key'
Run the bot using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python bot.py
Start a conversation with the Telegram bot and follow the prompts to provide input for generating the book outline and chapters.

                                    How It Works


The bot interacts with the user to collect information about the book, such as the topic, content, number of chapters, writing style, etc.

It uses the OpenAI API to generate a book plan based on the user input. The book plan includes chapter titles and a general plot for the book.

The bot then generates full chapters for the book based on the generated book plan. It refines and expands the short chapters to meet the specified word count.

The generated book outline and full chapters are saved in Markdown format and sent to the user via Telegram.

                                                Important Notes


                        
The bot relies on the OpenAI API for text generation. Make sure you have a valid OpenAI API key and adhere to OpenAI's usage policies.
